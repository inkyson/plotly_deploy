# **Belly Button Biodiversity**
## **Overview of the Belly Button Biodiversity Project**
In this project, we created a dynamic dashboard that visualize the bacterial data for each Improbable Beef project volunteer.  

We uitilized our knowlege of Plotly, JavaScript to create a dynamic HTML page.

## **Results**
The final product is a webpage that is stylistic and filters the data based on the individual volunteer's ID number. The filtered data shows that top 10 bacterial cultures found, belly button washing frequency and bacteria cultures found per sample.
